# Algorithm Practice Solutions in Java

This repository contains solutions to various algorithmic problems implemented in Java. The solutions focus on common programming challenges and interview-style questions, with an emphasis on clean code and efficient implementations.

## Project Structure

The project contains solutions to different types of algorithmic problems, organized by their category:

## Testing

Each solution includes corresponding unit tests that verify:
- Edge cases
- Common use cases
- Input constraints
- Expected outputs

The tests are written using JUnit Jupiter (JUnit 5) and can be found in the test directory matching the structure of the main code.

## Requirements

- Java 21 or higher
- JUnit Jupiter for running tests

## Running the Code

To run the tests, you can use your preferred IDE or run them via command line with:

```bash
./gradlew test
```
